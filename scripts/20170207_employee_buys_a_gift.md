### Extra Thought 오늘 배운 표현 응용하기
##### Do you play games?
[JMC] Yes. I play games with my smartphone. Especially, I play games when I was on my way to the school and home. It takes almost two hours to get the place, so I need something to play. And playing games is not only fun but also helps to get over the boring time.

[MISORANG] I do. Do you know Sims? Not Sim city. It's from the same parent company. But Sims is like playing with dolls for adults. So you build and control a neighborhood of virtual people and they're called Sims. And it's up to series four now. But I was completely addicted to them like at schools. So at one point, I said, when I was studying to get into a dental school, I said, you know, "Is it going to be dentistry or is it going to be Sims?" So I actually about three weeks off(?) so I had bought the new CD. I had to snap it in half because I was just on it 24/7. I have a very addictive personality so I try to stay away from them. Once I get into it, it's, that's what I'll be doing for the next a few weeks.


[Eugene] Baduk(go) on my cell phone. With our people through a cell phone. And there's a friend, I have a friend in Daegu. He and I are really good friends, which means we like to beat up each other. Um, so he and I play often in our cell phone.
[MISORANG] Just between you and me, who is better?
[Eugene] Oh, he is better. But his Baduk style is really really boring. I'm agreesive, somewhat creative, somewhat dangerous, risk taker in terms of Baduk, which is why he likes to play with me. We're like um sword and shield. A spear and a shield. The downside of it is because it's on your cell phone, I think my vision has deteriorated.
[MISORANG] How many hours do you spend for your vision to be affected?
[Eugene] Not that much but I don't think it's the hours. How many could be the hours. But it might, I think, it's the intensity.
